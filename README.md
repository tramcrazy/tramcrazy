- 👋 Hi, I’m @tramcrazy
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, Linux, programming, CompSci, ethical hacking, and basically all other technology ever.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ethical hacking and red team tactics, as well as some C++ on the side.
- 💞️ I’m collaborating as part of LiveG on products like the gDesk and Neuron.
- 📫 How to reach me - I prefer not to be contacted directly, so don't give contact details on the internet 😀
